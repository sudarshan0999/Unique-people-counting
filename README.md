Video People Counter with YOLO Tracking

Ever watched one of those crowded mall videos and wondered, "How many unique folks are actually in there?" Or maybe you're tinkering with surveillance cams and need a quick way to tally entries/exits without fancy hardware. That's what this little project is for—a simple Jupyter notebook that uses YOLOv8 to detect and track people in videos, spitting out counts of unique individuals and line crossings.
